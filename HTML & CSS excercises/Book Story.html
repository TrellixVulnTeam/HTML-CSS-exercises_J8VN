		<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
		<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <span id="jurnal">Nature</span>, <span id="jurnal">New Scientist</span>, and all other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <span id="jurnal">On the Road</span>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
		<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.</p>
